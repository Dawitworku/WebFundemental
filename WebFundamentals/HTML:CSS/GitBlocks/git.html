                <h2 class="nav-header">What is Git?</h2>
                <p class="nav-par">Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of
                    snapshots (commits) of your code base. With the creation of each snapshots
                    you build out a whole application, seeing the growth of a full app.
                    During this time you can make branches to experiment and come back to a previous
                    snapshots you took or merge those experiments into the your app.</p>
                <h2 class="nav-header">What is GitHub?</h2>
                <p class="nav-par">Github is a code hosting platform for version control
                    and collaboration. It lets you and others work together
                    on projects from anywhere using those code snapshots that you took during development.</p>

                    <p class="main-par"><span>Git init</span> is the act of registering this
                            current code base.</p>

                    <p class="main-par"><span>Git add</span> is how we stage the integration of our
                            current code base into our current list of snapshots</p>

                    to our last snapshot giving us a new snapshot of our code with whatever new changes were made </p>

                    <p class="main-par"><span>Git remote add</span> is used to set up a online repository
                    were we can place all of our current code. This is where the outside world can see our code base.</p>

                    <p class="main-par"><span>Git push</span> is how we get our code to Github, an 
                    excellent place to store all of our repositories. Other developers might look at our existing
                projects to see how we approached problems, pull down our code and add new features or even update our code 
                base with the features they wanted to add</p>
