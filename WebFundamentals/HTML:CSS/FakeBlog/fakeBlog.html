        <h1>Ghost The Siberian Husky</h1>
        <img src="img/Ghost.jpg" alt="Husky Puppy" width="250" height="250" title="Meet Ghost"/>

        <p> <strong>Ghost</strong> is playful, athletic, agile and light on his feet. He loves the great outdoors and requires vigorous<br> 
            excersice, especially in cool weather. He should be taken running, hiking, and/or biking everyday if possible, always on leash,<br> 
            as he is independent and born to run. If something cathches his intrest like a squarell, you will find him casing it. 
            Sometimes training him is a challenge because <br>he is a strong willed siberian Husky that is inclined to use his 
            intellegence in clever ways that suits his own purposes. Overall, he is a smart and fun to be around.
